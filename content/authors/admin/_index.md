# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: "I am interested in building inverse models that learn to caputure the rich and *structured representation* of our world from *unstructured observation*, through physical interactions of embodied agents. To this end, my research draws ideas from vision, graphics, robotics, and computational cognitive science."

I am a PhD student at [MIT CSAIL](https://csail.mit.edu/) working with  [Josh Tenenbaum](http://web.mit.edu/cocosci/josh.html) and [Vincent Sitzmann](https://www.vincentsitzmann.com/). Previously, I completed my B.S. in Computer Science at the University of Rochester. My research is partly supported by the [MIT Presidential Fellowship](https://oge.mit.edu/fellowships/presidential-graduate-fellowship-program/).

I am interested in building inverse models that capture the rich and *structured representation* of the physical world from *unstructured observation*. To this end, my research draws ideas from vision+graphics, computational cognitive science, and robotics.

**To master/undergraduate students**: If you would like to chat about life, career, or AI/ML research, feel free to email me. I encourage students from [underrepresented groups]() to reach out and will prioritize replying to these messages.
