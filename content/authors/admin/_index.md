bio: "I am interested in building inverse models that learn to caputure the rich and *structured representation* of our world from *unstructured observation*, through physical interactions of embodied agents. To this end, my research draws ideas from robotics, vision, graphics, and computational cognitive science."

I am an incoming PhD student at [MIT CSAIL](http://csail.mit.edu/). I am fortunate to receive the [MIT Presidential Fellowship](https://oge.mit.edu/fellowships/presidential-graduate-fellowship-program/).

I recently completed my B.S. in Computer Science with the highest honors in research at the University of Rochester. During my undergrad, I was a visiting student at MIT hosted by [Josh Tenenbaum](http://web.mit.edu/cocosci/josh.html), working closely with [Chuang Gan](http://people.csail.mit.edu/ganchuang/).

I am interested in building inverse models that learn to caputure the rich and *structured representation* of our world from *unstructured observation*, through physical interactions of embodied agents. To this end, my research draws ideas from robotics, vision, graphics, and computational cognitive science.
