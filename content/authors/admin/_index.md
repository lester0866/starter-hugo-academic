# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: "I am broadly interested in robot learning, computer vision, and (differentiable) physics simulation. The goal of my research is to allow autonomous agents to learn to acquire physics-informed representation of our world through interactions. To this end, I currently develop methods for robots to learn to interact with deformable objects such as plasticine and cloth."

I am a visiting student at MIT working on robot learning, hosted by [Chuang Gan](http://people.csail.mit.edu/ganchuang/) and [Josh Tenenbaum](http://web.mit.edu/cocosci/josh.html). 

I recently completed my B.S. in Computer Science with highest honors in research at the University of Rochester, where I worked with [Chenliang Xu](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/~cxu22/).
Initially, I was fortunate to work with [Thomas Serre](https://serre-lab.clps.brown.edu/person/thomas-serre/) on cancer detection, starting as a high school researcher at Brown University.

I was selected as a Finalist for Outstanding Undergraduate Researcher Award 2023 in North America by Computing Research Association.

I am broadly interested in robotics, computer vision, and machine learning. The goal of my research is to equip machines with physical knowledge that replicates the rapid physical inferences performed by humans. To this end, I have been developing predictive models that learn from and for physical interactions. In the past two years, I have focused on enabling robots to learn to interact with deformable objects, such as plasticine and cloth, with challenging physical dynamics.
